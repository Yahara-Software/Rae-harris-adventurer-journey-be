# Adventurer Journey - Back End

Please complete the story below and create a program to solve the problem. Commit any work back to the remote no later than 48 hours before the next interview.

_Please use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like to complete the story._

## Story Instructions

You are an adventurer standing in the center of a map facing North, and youâ€™re trying to weave through the terrain to your final destination. You have the directions to your destination indicating the number of steps and the direction to travel.

Adventurer Path & Instructions - [./Adventurer Path.md](./Adventurer%20Path.md)

Given the Path Instructions above, programmatically parse the instructions and determine what is the Euclidean (straight line) distance from your starting point to the destination in steps?

**Tech Notes:**

- Use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like.
- Provide any needed instructions to run program.
- Do not round to the nearest step.
- After program executes the answer should be returned.

**Running the Program**

- Enter _python3 AdventureJourney.py_ into the terminal to print out the Euclidean distance to the destination
- To test different directions, update the [./Adventurer Path.md](./Adventurer%20Path.md) file or manually call the distance calculating function with a test direction string by entering _python3 -c 'import AdventureJourney; print(AdventureJourney.calc\_euclidean\_dist(\<direction_string\>))'_ into the terminal. Replace \<direction_string\> with your directions (such as '15L4B')
